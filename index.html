              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                I am Heran Eshetu Elala, a dedicated and forward-thinking
                Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa University,
                currently involved in the A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley)
                program backed by Google. My passion lies in leveraging
                technology to create innovative solutions. I am known for being
                hardworking, excelling in multitasking and critical thinking. As
                a technology enthusiast, I am constantly seeking opportunities
                for self-improvement and growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                My technical skills span across frontend development with HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript, and beginner-level ReactJS. In backend
                development, I am proficient in NestJS. I also have experience
                in mobile app development using Flutter with Riverpod and Bloc
                at a beginner level. Additionally, I have a strong foundation in
                networking essentials, cloud and virtualization, and network
                virtualization. My competitive programming skills include a deep
                understanding of data structures and algorithms, particularly
                using Python.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond my technical expertise, I possess strong communication
                and leadership skills. Effective communication is one of my core
                strengths. I am adept at conveying complex technical concepts in
                a clear and understandable manner, whether I am collaborating
                with teammates, presenting project ideas, or engaging with
                stakeholders. My ability to articulate ideas and listen actively
                ensures that I can contribute meaningfully to any team or
                project.
              </p>
              <p>
                In terms of leadership, I have a proven track record of leading
                teams and projects to successful completion. I thrive in
                environments where I can take the initiative, motivate my peers,
                and drive projects forward. My leadership style is collaborative
                and inclusive, fostering a sense of teamwork and shared purpose.
                I believe in empowering team members by recognizing their
                strengths and encouraging their contributions, which leads to a
                more dynamic and productive work environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning,
                music, and traveling. I believe in continuous learning and
                actively seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and
                skills. I am always looking to collaborate and learn from
                others, aiming to make a significant impact in the field of
                software engineering. My goal is to leverage my skills and
                experiences to create innovative solutions that address
                real-world problems and contribute to the betterment of society.

            <p>
              A flutter hotel booking application, providing users with the
              ability to book rooms and admins to manage room details. The
              project incorporates various features to enhance user experience
              and security. I have had extensive experience in backend
              development, integration, and UI design.

            <p>
              The frontend design project for the restaurant will involve
              creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for the
              restaurant's website. The website will consist of various pages
              such as the home page, menu page, reservation page, about us page,
              contact page, and possibly a gallery page showcasing the
              restaurant's ambiance and dishes. I have gained extensive
              experience in frontend development.

              The system is designed to recognize hand gestures in real-time
              using a webcam. It leverages machine learning and computer vision
              techniques to detect hand landmarks, preprocess the captured
              images, and classify them into predefined gesture categories.
